# fab14 Auray Biomimicry

## Intro

First of all, I would like to see you ask a question:

> "what kinf of world do we want for ourselves, for our children, for everyone around us?"

Whatever the different answers we might debate, even before building proposals, we need vital imperatives to answer this question. These kits are:

+ A biopshère and biodiversity with natural resources preserved and maintained. Without it we simply disappear more today on the planet.
+ Fundamental freedoms established, shared and respected. Otherwise we're just other people's slave objects and we'll die.
+ Society that maintain and protect and guarantee these first two points. Ideals of democracy towards which we must always progress and never stop.

Unfortunately, today natural resources are threatened, biodiversity is collapsing, the earth's climate is warming.
This threatens humanity creating or reinforcing inequalities in the condition of life on the globe, it threatens our fundamental freedoms.

This creates tensions and conflicts over resources between different communities, between different societies and between different states. This situation spurs millions of people to flee to and exile towards better world hopes. In these conflicts and migrations thousands of people die.

Other people or organizations use these circumstances to instigate fear, which allows them to set up rules and control systems with the excuse of controlling these situations and depriving us of access to resources and fundamental freedoms.

Everywhere in the world democracies are in danger, in Europe the extreme right is taking power a little everywhere. Everywhere in the world of the deprived of freedom, everywhere in the world natural resources are damaged or confiscated.

## Fablabs

Do the Fablabs, and the people who make these fablabs, propose to deconstruct these mechanisms and try to bring solutions to these problems?

OR do the FabLabs only offer a "smart city police" model (ref : https://www.laquadrature.net/en/node/10447 ; ref : https://www.wired.co.uk/article/europe-immigration-refugees-smartphone-metadata-deportations) renowned and watered down "fab city"? A model in which the same social organization, the same rules, the same governance, take place but with new, more acceptable words?

> "_The idea of producing a space torn from the laws of the market is a dangerous utopia as long as one does not simultaneously ask the question of the conditions of potile possibilities of the generalization of this Utopia_" Pierre Bourdieu

## From Homo Faber to Homo Hominis

Until now, until the middle of the twentieth century, the technical processes that we had developed allowed us to modify the environment by external action, to make this world more welcoming to us, to make it more in line with our desires.
In recent decades, with advances in science and technology, new exploits have become possible and within our reach. We can change ourselves. We can act on social gourpes, modify individual entities, modify the chemistry and biology of our environment. We can modify our biological bodies.

In order not to leave the powers born of these new enjuex in the hands of a small handful of individuals, we decided in 2013 to create a free and distributed community of free and open source biomimicry practices.
A community before a lab, because FabLab, Hackerspace, Hacklab are much more than 4 walls and 1 roof.

They are people who meet and commit themselves to a shared responsibility, with common ethics and values decided and maintained by freely defined rules. This is done by preserving diversity of thought. In this social configuration people found a political act, an act that transforms the city, without becoming a politician.

Science and technology are not neutral either, since they are designed and used by humans who guide their conceptions and uses.

In this dual chain of responsibilities, practicing free and open source biomimicry with an open community is not just a hobby or distraction.

## Biomimicry

> But what is biomimicry?

It is a set of practices and disciplines that hybridize among themselves in order to imitate and copy the properties of forms, materials and architectures, and systems, present in nature develop by developed by nearly 4 billion years of evolution.

## Why? 

According to Otto Herbet Arnold Schmitt, it is a question of writing an exploration mode as a source of efficient and less costly solutions to many problems.

+ 3 examples of the Biome Hacklab

dandoleion & latex

Use dandelion sap to make rubber

Spirulina and photobioreactor

Imitate living systems to produce oxygen and food (algae, mushroom and gas from organic waste)

Meadow & energy

Imitate the symbiosis systems of nature and the movement of sea grass beds to produce energy, place this energy in a spatialized environment, distribute this energy in peer to peer programm and manage it as a common.

## For what purpose?


Life create condition conductive to life

and some times we do art inspire  mycelium's mushromm growing to develop algorithm in python language

## What we purpose now in Auray for Fab14

+ Ecology : fix biodiversity implantation issue, prototype and test a solution inspire by sea meadow (3d modelization or diy growing, biomaterial)

+ Liberty : collaborative process, antidisciplinary workflow, use free/libre license credit to of all contributors during workshop

+ Energy, LowRange communication (LoRa Protocol), internet of energy, energy as a common

> «_if no mesure is taken, the energy to power the infrastructure of the web in 2050 would be tantamount to the energy consumed by humanity in 2008_» W3C

+ Citizen movement : Initialize firts steps to a DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization wherever you come from

## keep in mind

> «_Biomimicry is a learning process, based and staked out within experimentation and prototyping, questioning ethic, promising an ecology and sustainable ways. Working design, working biology, working code, working architecture, are only a side-effect. We need to learn and share knowledge, practices and documentations. For these conditions, we need a free and open source system._»
